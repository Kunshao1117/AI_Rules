# _ag_core.support.workflows-audit-commit — Antigravity Audit and Commit Workflow Memory

## Current Truth
- This child card owns Antigravity audit, audit subphase, and commit execution workflow entries.
- Audit workflows use evidence status and project-surface routing rather than a fixed scan checklist.
- Audit workflows now support quick, standard, deep, and forensic depth modes with feature, endpoint, command, job, interface, data-flow, performance, and risk inventories.
- Commit workflows must not bypass Director gates for git state changes.

## Active Constraints
- Do not mark missing evidence as green or complete.
- Do not claim full coverage from sampled evidence; report coverage denominators and sampling limits.
- Do not commit, push, tag, or release without explicit Director approval.

## Cycle Events
- 01: Split Antigravity audit and commit workflow ownership out of the support parent card.
- 02: Updated Antigravity audit entry and subphases for depth selection, inventory construction, visual evidence mapping, and coverage reporting.

## Archive Index
- Parent archive remains at .agents/memory/_ag_core/support/archive-001.md.

## Evidence Base
- source:.agents/memory/_ag_core/support/archive-001.md — Previous support-card content preserved during migration.
- tool:memory_audit — Granularity advisory identified this support card as broad by tracked-file count.
- director:2026-06-15 — GO SPLIT authorized focused child-card split.

## Read Contract
- Read this card when changing owned Antigravity support files.
- Read `_ag_core.support` only for support-family navigation and platform context.

## Conflicts and Supersession
- No unresolved conflict recorded during this split; newly found contradictions must be indexed here.

## 中文摘要
- 此子卡負責 Antigravity 健檢與提交相關工作流。
- 缺證據不能當通過；Git 外部狀態仍需總監授權。

## Tracked Files
- Antigravity/.agents/workflows/08_audit(健檢).md
- Antigravity/.agents/workflows/08-1_audit_infra(基礎盤點).md
- Antigravity/.agents/workflows/08-2_audit_logic(深度邏輯).md

## Relations
- _ag_core.support (parent card: Antigravity support index)
- _shared (shared workflow matrix and audit semantics)

## Applicable Skills
- memory-ops — Use when updating this child card.
- memory-arch — Use when adjusting Antigravity support topology.
- impact-test-strategy — Use when workflow changes affect multiple entrypoints.
