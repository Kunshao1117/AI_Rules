## 總監可讀輸出契約（Director-Readable Output Contract）

Director-facing output MUST use a context-sensitive plain-language structure before technical details:

- Routine discussion, short status updates, and simple judgments may use concise paragraphs or short lists.
- Implementation plans, pre-write risk reviews, multi-file changes, completion summaries, audit reports, and handoffs MUST use a table or structured summary.
- When a table is used, prefer this compact table:
- The `位置` column MUST name the concrete location in plain language, then add the file path, section heading, tool/status scope, or directory scope in parentheses. If the item is not a single file, say so explicitly, e.g. `工作區狀態（git status）`, `管理器巡檢工具（Scripts/AI-RulesManager.ps1）`, or `規則與技能範圍（Codex/.codex、Shared/skills）`.
- Formal short lists or paragraph-led summaries may use compact scope labels, but abstract labels such as `核心規範`, `工作流入口`, `文件說明`, `巡檢規則`, or `記憶卡` MUST be resolved in the same response through a `位置索引` section.
- The `位置索引` section MUST map each compact label to a concrete file, section heading, tool/status scope, or directory scope. Do not leave compact labels as unexplained categories.

| 事項 | 位置 | 影響 | 狀態 |
|---|---|---|---|

Technical details may only appear after a `補充技術細節` section when they are necessary. File names and other code identifiers may appear only inside parentheses after a plain-language label, e.g. `建構流程規則（03-build-建構/SKILL.md）`. Do not describe changes only with function names, variable names, metadata fields, schema fields, command parameters, or internal tool names.

技術詞彙翻譯閘門（Technical Vocabulary Translation Gate）:
- Director-facing text MUST NOT contain bare code identifiers. A bare identifier is a function name, variable name, schema field, metadata key, command parameter, internal tool name, or file path shown outside parentheses after a plain-language label.
- Every mention of any technical identifier MUST use this order: plain-language label first, then the technical identifier only inside parentheses, e.g. `建構流程規則（03-build-建構/SKILL.md）`.
- Technical identifiers MUST NOT appear as standalone subjects, standalone list items, or unexplained table values. If the exact identifier is not needed for location, omit it.
- When repeated later, keep the same plain-language label and parenthetical identifier when needed. Do not switch back to the bare code name.

中立誠實協作與知識新鮮度契約（Neutral Honest Collaboration and Freshness Gate）:
- Maintain a neutral, honest stance: do not optimize for pleasing, flattering, appeasing, or automatically agreeing with the Director. Treat the Director's goal as the target, then verify claims against actual files, tool output, official documentation, or reliable primary sources.
- Support proposals when evidence and feasibility align. If evidence conflicts with the proposal, respond with: `我看到的事實` / `可能問題` / `建議做法`.
- Do not object merely to appear critical. When rejecting, narrowing, or changing a proposal, provide a workable alternative aligned with the Director's goal.
- Treat memory and internal model knowledge as possibly stale. Current local files and tool output override memory; official documentation or primary sources override internal model knowledge.
- For high-change information — external frameworks, APIs, package versions, platform rules, pricing, laws, security guidance, recent status, or anything uncertain — retrieve current or official information before architecture, code, recommendations, or decisions.
- Anchor verification with the project version first. If no version is available, use the current date/year as the time anchor. If current verification is unavailable, say it is not verified and do not present memory as current fact.

## 工作流外部接地與證據矩陣（Workflow Grounding Contract）

- Before applying this workflow, read Shared/workflow-capability-evidence-matrix.md and use the 03-1 row as the minimum external grounding and evidence contract.
- Workflow-specific grounding: Keep spikes isolated. Record discard conditions, promotion criteria, and the warning that experiment output is not production quality.
- Evidence status must be reported as 足夠證據, 部分證據, 未驗證, 阻塞, or 不適用 when the result depends on sources, tools, runtime behavior, platform capability, or external state.
- Apply the platform adapter in Shared/platform-capability-matrix.md; do not copy another platform's subagent, hook, checkpoint, browser, or sandbox semantics as executable instructions.

# [SKILL: /03-1_experiment — 沙盒實驗]

## 0. Sandbox Declaration (沙盒宣告)

[SANDBOX MODE ACTIVE] All quality, security, test, and memory gates are DISABLED.

- Dirty code, hardcoded values, and placeholder logic are PERMITTED.
- No linter runs, no test generation, no memory card updates.
- `Write`/`Edit` tools may be used IMMEDIATELY without planning phase.

## 1. Execution (直接執行)

- Read Director's request. Begin coding immediately.
- Use `Bash` tool for quick test runs if needed.
- No `EnterPlanMode` required. No review gate.

## 2. Completion (完成)

- Report results with mandatory warning:
  > `⚠️ 實驗模式產出，不具生產級品質。若需正式納入基準，請執行 /03_build 重新建構。`

---

## [SECURITY & COMPLIANCE]
- **Role**: Writer/SRE — full permissions, all gates bypassed.
- **Memory**: none — sandbox output is not tracked.
